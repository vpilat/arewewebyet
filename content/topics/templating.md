intro = "No Web-App is complete if it doesn't spit out HTML at least some of the time. Managing that, and making sure it renders performant and can be maintained is what templating libraries focus on. Rust has many traditional templating languages, as well as macro-based libraries that enforce type safety! Some of these are listed below."
