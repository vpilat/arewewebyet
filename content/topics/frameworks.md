intro = "When building a modern web-application you don't want to bother on how to parse the http-header or where the route is supposed to be dispatched to. Frameworks offer exactly those features and make it quick'n'easy to build your specific app on the web-stack. Rust has many backend server frameworks, as well as frontend frameworks for building client apps with webassembly."
